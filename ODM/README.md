ODM (Object Data Modeling)

## What is an ODM?

An **ODM (Object Data Modeling)** library is a tool that allows developers to interact with a NoSQL database (like MongoDB) using **objects in their application code**.

It provides:

- A way to define schemas and models
- Easy methods for querying and updating data
- Built-in validation and middleware
- Abstraction over low-level database operations

ODMs are to NoSQL databases what ORMs are to SQL databases.
