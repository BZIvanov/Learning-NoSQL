# Mongoose

## Why Mongoose?

In this repository, we use **Mongoose** as the default ODM for MongoDB.

Mongoose is a powerful and popular Node.js library that makes working with MongoDB easier by:

- Providing schema definitions for your documents
- Enabling data validation, default values, and relationships
- Simplifying CRUD operations with a clean API
